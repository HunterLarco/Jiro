#TODO

1. Impliment private and public server keys for mobile devices

>  The private keys will be used for sending data in the Jiro App whereas the public keys will be used as references for connecting from the host.
>  This should reduce the ability to use the identifier of each device from JiroJS to send data as the device

2. Create the API Server template
3. Create the JiroPY module
4. Continue the gettingstarted docs
