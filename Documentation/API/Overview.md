###Overview

The JiroAPI communicates with your server or the entry point to connect mobile devices quickly and reliably to the client. Use of the API relies solely on Javascript, this documentation provides the necessary information to use it.

###Downloading The Client

Download [Jiro.js](/build/Jiro.js) and include it in your html.
```html
<script src='js/Jiro.js'></script>
```

###Which API To Use

If you use the Jiro via the entry point, you will be bound by quotas over resources and connection time. This is done to limit costs on our server. Using your own server, however, is absolutely free and without limits. The documentation easily walks you through installing Jiro onto your server.
